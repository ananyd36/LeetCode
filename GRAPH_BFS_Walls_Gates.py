# Islands and Treasure
# Solved 
# You are given a 
# m
# Ã—
# n
# mÃ—n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values:

# -1 - A water cell that can not be traversed.
# 0 - A treasure chest.
# INF - A land cell that can be traversed. We use the integer 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF.
# Fill each land cell with the distance to its nearest treasure chest. If a land cell cannot reach a treasure chest then the value should remain INF.

# Assume the grid can only be traversed up, down, left, or right.

# Modify the grid in-place.

# Example 1:

# Input: [
#   [2147483647,-1,0,2147483647],
#   [2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1],
#   [2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1],
#   [0,-1,2147483647,2147483647]
# ]

# Output: [
#   [3,-1,0,1],
#   [2,2,1,-1],
#   [1,-1,2,-1],
#   [0,-1,3,4]
# ]
