# You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

# Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
# Output: false
# Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.




class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        goal = len(nums) - 1

        for i in range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1):
            if i + nums[i] >= goal:
                goal = i
        return goal == 0




# You start by setting a “goal” at the last index.
# You move backwards through the array.
# For each index, you check if you can jump from there to the current goal (or further).
# If you can, you update the goal to your current index.
# At the end, if your goal is 0, it means you can reach the last index from the start.
# It’s a smart and efficient way to solve the Jump Game using a greedy strategy!
