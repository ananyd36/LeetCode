# You are given an image represented by an m x n grid of integers image, where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image. You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. Your task is to perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].

# To perform a flood fill:

# Begin with the starting pixel and change its color to color.
# Perform the same process for each pixel that is directly adjacent (pixels that share a side with the original pixel, either horizontally or vertically) and shares the same color as the starting pixel.
# Keep repeating this process by checking neighboring pixels of the updated pixels and modifying their color if it matches the original color of the starting pixel.
# The process stops when there are no more adjacent pixels of the original color to update.
# Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.

#  Example 1:

# Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2

# Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]


#DFS can be faster because it goes deep into one path, changing pixels quickly, so often less overhead per step. 
# But it uses the call stack, which can cause stack overflow for large images. 
# BFS is more memory-efficient in practice because it uses a queue and explores level by levelâ€”avoiding deep recursion.


# Time complexity is O(m*n) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid.
# Space complexity is O(m*n) for the visited set.
