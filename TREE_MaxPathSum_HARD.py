# A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

# The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

# Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: root = [1,2,3]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

        Calculates the maximum path sum for a given binary tree.

        A "path" is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node
        in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least
        one node and does not need to pass through the root.

        The core idea is to use a Depth First Search (DFS) approach. For each node,
        we calculate the maximum path sum that *ends* at this node and can extend upwards
        to its parent. This is `node.val + max(left_child_path, right_child_path)`.

        Simultaneously, we calculate the maximum path sum that is "centered" at the
        current node, which includes the node itself, its left child's path, and its
        right child's path (`node.val + left_path + right_path`). This value is used
        to update a global maximum, as this "split" path cannot extend further up
        the tree.

        Args:
            root (Optional[TreeNode]): The root node of the binary tree.

        Returns:
            int: The maximum path sum found in the tree.

            """
            A recursive helper function to perform DFS traversal.

            For each node, it does two things:
            1. Updates the overall maximum path sum (`res`) if a path through the
               current node (including both its left and right children) is greater.
            2. Returns the maximum path sum that *starts* at the current node and goes
               downwards (either left or right), to be used by its parent.

            Args:
                node (Optional[TreeNode]): The current node in the traversal.

            Returns:

# Complexity Analysis
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Time Complexity: O(N)
#   - Where N is the total number of nodes in the tree.
#   - The DFS algorithm visits each node exactly once.
#
# Space Complexity: O(H)
#   - Where H is the height of the tree.
#   - This is the space used by the recursion stack.
#   - In the best case (a completely balanced tree), H = log(N), so space is O(log N).
#   - In the worst case (a skewed tree, like a linked list), H = N, so space is O(N).
